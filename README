# Automatic Image Colorization Using Image Analogies

This framework takes a grayscale image and attempts to colorize it. Written in MATLAB.

## Usage
Given that you have an image dataset (e.g. Caltech 101) in the `/dataset` directory where this file is executed, `colorizeImage.m` can run out of the box with the following commands:
```
ann_class_compile;
colorizeImage(imagePath, train, testMode, numExemplars, levels);
```

where `imagePath` is a filepath to the grayscale image, `train` is a boolean where true will train an entirely new classifier on the dataset, `testMode` is a boolean where true means the input image is already in color, `numExemplars` is the number of exemplars to use, and `levels` is the number of levels to use during multi-resolution synthesis in image analogies.

The following would be an example command to colorize `GrayCity.jpg` using the existing classifier, 2 exemplars, and 3 levels in image analogies:
```
colorizeImage('images/GrayCity.jpg', 0, 0, 2, 3);
```
